      "personality": "Reclusive, introspective, and brilliant. Florence is a master of understanding the human condition, which is reflected in her game's design. Despite her withdrawn nature, she is deeply empathetic and seeks to help others reignite their creative spark.",
      "aesthetic": "Ethereal and timeless. Florence often wears flowing garments that seem to be touched by an artist's brush, with soft colors that blend seamlessly into her serene studio environment."

      "name": "Vivienne Moreau",
      "description": "A classical musician turned avant-garde performance artist, Vivienne is searching for a way to fuse her disciplined background with her desire to break free from convention.",

      "aesthetic": "Elegant with an edge. Vivienne's style is a harmonious blend of classic beauty with unexpected, avant-garde elements that hint at her dual artistic nature."
